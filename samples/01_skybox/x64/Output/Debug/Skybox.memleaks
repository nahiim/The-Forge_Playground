This file contains a log of all memory operations performed during the last run.

Interrogate this file to track errors or to help track down memory-related
issues. You can do this by tracing the allocations performed by a specific owner
or by tracking a specific address through a series of allocations and
reallocations.

There is a lot of useful information here which, when used creatively, can be
extremely helpful.

Note that the following guides are used throughout this file:

   [!] - Error
   [+] - Allocation
   [~] - Reallocation
   [-] - Deallocation
   [I] - Generic information
   [F] - Failure induced for the purpose of stress-testing your application
   [D] - Information used for debugging this memory manager

...so, to find all errors in the file, search for "[!]"
